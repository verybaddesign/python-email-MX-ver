# python-email-MX-ver
A poorly optimized attempt to vet incoming e-mail domains against known spam MX providers. 

This isn't intended for the bigger free domains - Google, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc should already move spam mail server domains. For smaller personal domains or more niche mail services, this does present an application in stopping endless loads of bad attachments from being clicked out of your curiousity. 

Alternatively, you can use a whitelist to filter out any possible bad results, then later add false positives to an exception list.

# python-email-MX-ver
A poorly optimized attempt to vet incoming e-mail domains against known spam MX providers. 

##This definition will take a specified domain and check its Mail Exchange (MX) server against a spam list to return a boolean value. A known spam domain is chosen for the example.##
def readTed(dmn):
  import dns.resolver
  spam="generator.email" ##Add additional domains with an 'and' boolean.##
  for i in dns.resolver.resolve(dmn, 'MX'): 
    return(spam in i.to_text())

##This is an example use of the function which will return with a False.##

##This use case shows using the previous function embedded to translate the True or False boolean into a more easily interpreted response.##
def readIndustrialSocietyandItsFuture(dmn):
  if readTed(dmn) == True:
    print('Blocked!')
  else:
    print('Okay.')

##If I wrote this correctly - big IF - then you should return an 'Okay.' as the result, meaning that your choice for a domain is not generated by anything understood to be a spam mail generator.##
